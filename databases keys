 A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no duplicate 
values exist and that each record can be uniquely identified

A Foreign Key is a field in a table that refers to the Primary Key of another table. It
establishes a relationship between two tables and ensures data consistency.

A Composite Key is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table.

A Candidate Key is a column or a set of columns that can uniquely identify any 
record in a table. There can be more than one candidate key in a table, but only one 
can be chosen as the primary key
