<!--//An event is an occurrence of something initiated by the user i.e {click}
//A listener is a function that is called when an event occurs
//An action to respond to the event is called an event handler
//An event handler refers to the function that handles the event
//Event delegation is removing redaduncy from every element having its own event handler
//Event delegation is a technique where you attach an event handler to a parent element and then use the
//event.target to determine which element actually triggered the event
//Event propagation is where an event goes top bottom (Parent to child)
//Event bubbling is where an event goes bottom up (Child to parent)
